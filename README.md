# BreastCancer Cell Detection


The task is to develop a model that predicts whether a biopsied breast cell is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous), given a set of attributes about the cell.

Sample code number: id number Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 Mitoses: 1 - 10 Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
